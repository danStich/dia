\description{
Upstream inefficiency table from the Atlantic salmon 
Dam Impact Analysis model v67. When adult Atlantic salmon do not 
pass a dam, a proportion of those fish die, a proportion return 
to sea, and a proportion go elsewhere to attempt to spawn. These values are
used in combination with the \code{\link{straying_matrix}} to spatially
distribute returning adult spawners in each generation of simulations.
